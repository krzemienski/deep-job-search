# Deep Job Search Project Requirements Document

---

## 1. Project Overview

The Deep Job Search Platform is designed to help tech professionals and recent graduates quickly find job opportunities that match their skills, experiences, and preferences. Using a combination of resume parsing and AI-driven research, the system extracts key information from uploaded resumes and then generates a tailored job search prompt based on user-defined parameters. This prompt is used to fetch a curated list of job listings that are highly relevant to the candidate’s background, reducing the time spent in traditional job hunting approaches.

The project is being built to streamline and personalize the job search process by leveraging modern web technologies and artificial intelligence. The key objectives are to simplify resume processing, allow users to fine-tune their job preferences, and present an easily navigable interface displaying relevant job openings. Success will be measured by the accuracy of resume parsing, relevance of curated job listings, and overall user satisfaction with the experience.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**
- Resume Upload & Parsing: Allow users to upload a resume (PDF/image) and automatically extract key details using OCR when necessary.
- Deep Research Task Generation: Use the parsed resume data combined with user preferences (location, role type, company size, etc.) to generate a tailored search prompt for the job listing query.
- Curated Job Listing Results: Return and display a structured list of job positions, including essential details like title, company, and application link.
- Responsive and modern user interface built with Next.js, designed for both desktop and mobile users.
- Integration with OpenAI’s API (or equivalent) for summarizing resumes and generating deep research prompts.
- Cloud storage integration (using AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or similar) for handling user-uploaded resumes.

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Third-party job listing API integrations (e.g., Indeed, LinkedIn) in the initial release, relying solely on AI aggregation for job listings.
- User account creation and authentication features; these will be considered future enhancements.
- Advanced filtering options such as salary range, remote vs. on-site beyond basic location and company size preferences.
- Multi-language support outside of English for the initial version.

## 3. User Flow

A new user lands on the Home/Landing page where they are greeted with a brief overview of the Deep Job Search Platform and a clear call-to-action to get started. After clicking the "Get Started" button, the user is taken to the Resume Upload page, where they can either drag-and-drop or select a resume file (in PDF or image format) for upload. Upon submission, the backend processes the file, extracts the text (using OCR if necessary), and generates a brief summary preview.

Once the resume is successfully parsed, the user proceeds to the Preferences page, where they can set parameters such as preferred location, company size, type of roles, and any additional job-specific instructions. After setting these preferences, the user is directed to the Results page, which displays a curated list of matching job listings. Here, each job entry includes key details and an "Apply" link that directs the user to further application steps. This streamlined flow ensures users quickly move from upload and configuration to receiving actionable job recommendations.

  - Styling & Interactivity: Technologies like Tailwind CSS, Material UI, or custom CSS can be used.
  - Mobile Optimization: Responsive design principles to ensure usability across mobile devices.
  - IDE/Plugin Support: Tools such as Windsurf, Cursor, and VS Code for rapid development with AI-powered assistance.

- **Backend:**
  - Language & Framework: Python using Flask or FastAPI to handle API requests.
  - AI Integration: OpenAI API for resume summarization and deep research task generation; additional models like GPT-4 O1 may be involved.
  - Cloud Storage: Integration with AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for secure resume storage.
  - Additional Tools: Use of Aider for AI-assisted coding in the terminal and Replit for collaborative code editing if needed.

- **AI Models & Libraries:**
  - Primary LLM: OpenAI’s API (e.g., GPT-4) for natural language processing tasks.
  - Additional Assistance: Claude AI as a secondary model for intelligent code assistance and refinement.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
  - Optimized API calls to ensure resume parsing and job listing generation occur quickly.
  - Aim for sub-second response times for front-end interactions, with backend operations (like API calls) targeting minimal latency.

- **Security:**
  - Secure handling and storage of user-uploaded resumes using cloud storage best practices.
  - Secure management of API keys (using environment variables and secure vaults).
  - Proper error handling and logging for critical failures, particularly around file processing and external API interactions.

- **Usability:**
  - A clean, intuitive design that caters to both desktop and mobile users.
  - Accessibility compliance to ensure the interface is usable by everyone.
  - Minimal setup required for users – the process from resume upload to job results should be straightforward.

- **Compliance:**
  - Adherence to data protection and privacy regulations, ensuring users’ resume information is handled confidentially.
  - Use of secure communication channels (HTTPS) for all data transfers.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- The project assumes that users will provide resumes in commonly used formats (PDFs or images); handling of .docx or other file types is not in the initial scope.
- It is assumed that OpenAI’s API (or equivalent service) will remain available and responsive with the provided API keys.
- The platform will initially target job listings within the United States while allowing for user-defined regional preferences.
- User account management and authentication are planned for future enhancements; all users initially have the same access.
- The development will leverage cloud storage solutions (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for scalability and secure data management.
- The frontend will be built using Next.js with the possibility of integrating with various UI libraries without being restricted to one specific option.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- API Rate Limits: Excessive calls to external services (e.g., OpenAI API) may result in rate limiting. A caching mechanism or queueing system might be needed to handle high loads.
- File Upload Challenges: Different resume formats and potential OCR failures may occur if the resume image quality is low or the file format is uncommon. Robust error handling and user notifications are essential.
- Dynamic Prompt Generation: Crafting deep research prompts that consistently yield relevant job listings might need periodic refining as user preferences and job market realities evolve.
- Integration Complexity: Although third-party job APIs are out-of-scope for the initial version, planning for future integration should be considered to avoid architectural changes later.
- AI Summarization Accuracy: Reliance on an LLM (such as GPT-4) for resume summarization and job research development requires that prompts be well-crafted to ensure useful outputs. Iterative testing and prompt tuning will be critical.
- Mobile Optimization: Ensuring a seamless experience across different devices can pose challenges in UI responsiveness and rendering; periodic testing across devices and screen sizes is recommended.
