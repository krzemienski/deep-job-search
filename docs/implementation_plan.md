## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. Install Node.js (latest LTS version) and ensure a working installation by running `node -v` (Reference: PRD Section 1 and Tech Stack - Frontend).

2. Install Python (latest stable 3.x version) and verify with `python --version` (Reference: PRD Section 1 and Tech Stack - Backend).

3. Create a new Git repository for the project with two main branches: `main` and `dev`. Commit an initial README explaining the project architecture (Reference: PRD Section 1.4).

4. Set up AWS CLI and configure credentials for AWS S3 (or desired cloud storage) in region `us-east-1`. Save config in `~/.aws/credentials` (Reference: PRD Section 3, Cloud Storage Integration).

5. Initialize a Next.js project for the frontend by running:
   `npx create-next-app deep-job-search-frontend`
   (The project will live in `/frontend`).

6. Initialize a Python virtual environment for the backend and install FastAPI and Uvicorn (choose FastAPI as it is flexible for REST APIs). Create a folder named `/backend` for backend code.

7. **Validation:** Run `node -v` and `python --version` and check that AWS CLI returns correct settings via `aws sts get-caller-identity`.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1. Create the Home/Landing page at `/frontend/pages/index.js` implementing a header/navbar and a "Get Started" button that routes to the Resume Upload page (Reference: PRD Section 3.1 Home / Landing).

2. Develop the Resume Upload page at `/frontend/pages/resume-upload.js` featuring a drag-and-drop file input and standard file selector. Ensure it contains a form that submits the resume to the backend endpoint `POST /api/upload_resume` (Reference: PRD Section 3.2 Resume Upload).

3. Build the Preferences page at `/frontend/pages/preferences.js` that includes input fields and toggles for location, company size, roles, and an additional requests text box, with a button labeled "Continue / Next" (Reference: PRD Section 3.3 Preferences).

4. Create the Results page at `/frontend/pages/results.js` which displays a list of job cards. Each card should include job title, company, location, and an "Apply" link opening in a new tab (Reference: PRD Section 3.4 Results).

5. Implement responsive design using your preferred UI library (e.g., Tailwind CSS or Material UI) and ensure the site works well on mobile devices (Reference: PRD Section 4, Frontend Ambiguity).

6. **Validation:** Run the Next.js development server with `npm run dev` and manually verify transitions between pages and functionality of all form components.

---

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1. In the `/backend` folder, create a main FastAPI application file named `main.py`. Set up a basic FastAPI app and run it using Uvicorn (Reference: PRD Section 2.2 Backend).

2. Create an endpoint for resume uploads. In `/backend/app.py`, define the endpoint `POST /api/upload_resume` to accept file uploads. This endpoint should save the file temporarily and trigger resume parsing (Reference: PRD Section 2.1 Resume Upload & Parsing).

3. Implement a Python function `parse_resume(file)` inside `/backend/utils/parse_resume.py` that checks the file type (PDF vs image) and, if an image is uploaded, triggers OCR (using Tesseract or a similar package) to extract text (Reference: PRD Section 4, Resume Parsing).

4. Create another function `summarize_resume(text)` inside `/backend/utils/summarization.py` to forward the extracted text to the OpenAI API. Use an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` for authentication. Ensure this function returns a structured JSON containing the summary (Reference: PRD Section 4, OpenAI API Integration).

5. Develop an endpoint `POST /api/deep_search` in `/backend/app.py` that accepts user preferences and the previously generated resume summary. This endpoint should call a helper function `create_deep_search_prompt(summary, preferences)` (placed in `/backend/utils/prompt_generator.py`) which builds the AI prompt. Then use `call_openai_for_jobs(prompt)` (also in `/backend/utils/prompt_generator.py`) to get job listings (Reference: PRD Section 2.2 Backend and Section 5 Sample “Deep Research” Prompt).

6. Configure integration with AWS S3 for storing the uploaded resumes. Create a config file `/backend/config/aws_config.py` that sets up boto3 client with your credentials, and update the upload endpoint to save files to a specified S3 bucket in `us-east-1` (Reference: PRD Section 2.2 and Cloud Storage Integration in PRD Section 4).

7. **Validation:** Use `curl` commands to test both endpoints:
   - For upload: `curl -F "file=@path/to/test_resume.pdf" http://localhost:8000/api/upload_resume`
   - For deep search: Post a JSON payload with sample preferences to `http://localhost:8000/api/deep_search` and verify a valid JSON response.

---

## Phase 4: Integration

1. In the Next.js frontend, modify the Resume Upload page (`/frontend/pages/resume-upload.js`) to submit the file using a `fetch` or `axios` POST request to `http://<backend-host>:8000/api/upload_resume` and handle the JSON response, displaying a preview of the parsed resume summary (Reference: PRD Section 3.2 Resume Upload Flow).

2. Connect the Preferences page form to the backend deep search endpoint by issuing a POST request from `/frontend/pages/preferences.js` to `http://<backend-host>:8000/api/deep_search` once preferences are set (Reference: PRD Section 2.1 Deep Research Task Generation).

3. On successful job listing retrieval from the deep search endpoint, route to `/frontend/pages/results.js` and pass the job listings for display (Reference: PRD Section 3.4 Results Page).

4. **Validation:** Test the end-to-end flow in development by uploading a test resume, setting preferences, and confirming that the results page displays a JSON list converted into job cards with clickable links.

---

## Phase 5: Deployment

1. Deploy the Next.js frontend to Vercel. Push the `/frontend` project to a Git repository and connect with Vercel’s deployment via its dashboard (Reference: PRD Section 5, Deployment guidelines).

2. Deploy the Python backend. Choose a deployment option such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk or similar. Prepare a deployment script and Dockerfile if needed; for example, create `/backend/Dockerfile` that runs the FastAPI app with Uvicorn (Reference: PRD Section 5, Deployment).

3. Ensure the AWS S3 bucket for resume storage is active in region `us-east-1` and that proper IAM roles are assigned for secure access (Reference: PRD Section 4 Cloud Storage Integration).

4. **Validation:** After deployment, run end-to-end tests using tools like Postman and manually test the UI via production URLs; check that API calls return expected results and uploaded files are stored in S3.

---

## Phase 6: Post-Launch

1. Set up monitoring and logging for both frontend and backend. For the backend, integrate a logging framework (e.g., Python’s logging module) and consider using AWS CloudWatch alarms especially monitoring API response times (Reference: PRD Section 6 Non-Functional Requirements).

2. Add error handling and alerting for failed resume uploads or OCR/parsing issues. Update API endpoints to return clear error messages and log detailed error info (Reference: PRD Section 4 Error Handling & Logging).

3. Plan for regular backups of user-uploaded resumes stored in S3 by scheduling a daily backup script using AWS Lambda or a cron job on the backend server (Reference: PRD Section 7 Future Enhancements).

4. Schedule user experience testing especially on mobile devices to ensure UI responsiveness and seamless navigation. Prepare feedback loops to refine features based on user input (Reference: PRD Section 6 Usability).

5. **Validation:** Simulate production traffic with tools like Locust or simple load testing and verify that performance metrics (e.g. API latency, UI responsiveness) remain within acceptable thresholds.
