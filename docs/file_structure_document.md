# Introduction

A well-organized file structure is essential for a project like the Deep Job Search Platform because it creates a clear roadmap for both the frontend and backend components. This organization not only simplifies development but also improves collaboration among team members. In our project, which parses user-uploaded resumes, generates deep research prompts based on user preferences, and displays curated job listings, every file and directory has its own clear purpose. This clarity is especially important when integrating various technologies and tools such as Next.js, Python with Flask or FastAPI, and cloud storage solutions.

# Overview of the Tech Stack

The project uses a modern web framework built in Next.js for the frontend, delivering a responsive and intuitive user experience. The backend is developed in Python using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI to handle the core API endpoints. OpenAI’s API plays a key role in processing resumes and generating deep job search prompts. Cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage are integrated to securely manage user-uploaded files. In addition, a variety of intelligent code-assistance tools help streamline the development process. This robust tech stack influences the file structure, ensuring a logical separation of concerns between the user interface, business logic, and configuration management.

# Root Directory Structure

At the root level of the project, you will find the overall entry points and documentation that guide both development and deployment of the entire system. Core files like README.md provide a high-level overview while configuration files such as package.json and requirements.txt manage dependencies for the frontend and backend respectively. Directories like /frontend and /backend encapsulate the distinct areas of the application. The /frontend directory holds all files related to the Next.js-based user interface, including pages for the home page, resume upload, preference settings, and job results. The /backend directory contains Python files that implement API endpoints like /api/upload_resume and /api/deep_search along with utility functions such as resume parsing, summarization, and prompt generation. There is also a /docs directory that stores all project documentation including this file structure document, PRD, and technical guides.

# Configuration and Environment Files

Configuration is a key part of setting up a reliable and secure project. At the project root, environment configuration files such as .env.example are provided to outline crucial variables like the OPENAI_API_KEY, settings related to cloud storage, and other sensitive information. Version control friendly files like .gitignore ensure that sensitive data and unnecessary artifacts are not tracked. Additionally, build configurations for Next.js (next.config.js) and dependency management files (package.json for frontend and requirements.txt for backend) are placed at the root. These configurations serve to streamline development and deployment tasks while keeping the system flexible and secure.

# Documentation Structure

The documentation within this project is organized in its own dedicated directory (/docs) to support quality assurance and effective knowledge sharing. This directory not only includes this File Structure Document but also houses other important documents such as the project requirements document (PRD), tech stack details, frontend guidelines, backend structure, and additional implementation plans. By keeping all documentation centralized, team members can quickly locate and refer to essential guides, ensuring that everyone stays aligned with project goals and development best practices.

# Conclusion and Overall Summary

In summary, the file structure of the Deep Job Search Platform has been thoughtfully organized to facilitate both development and maintenance. By clearly segregating frontend and backend components, centralizing critical configuration files, and maintaining a robust documentation directory, the project maintains a high level of clarity and efficiency. The integration of Next.js for the user interface and Python for backend services—combined with modern cloud storage solutions and AI-powered tools—results in a unique file organization that is scalable, easy to understand, and adaptable to future enhancements. This structure not only supports the immediate development needs but also sets a strong foundation for future growth and updates.
