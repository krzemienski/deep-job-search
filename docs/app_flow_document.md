# Introduction
The Deep Job Search application is built to simplify and streamline the process of finding job opportunities for tech professionals and recent graduates. By combining the power of resume parsing, artificial intelligence, and user-defined search preferences, this application makes it easy for users to upload a resume, extract key details, set job preferences, and receive a curated list of job listings. The application uses a modern Next.js frontend and a Python backend, integrating with OpenAI’s APIs to perform text extraction, summarization, and prompt generation. This document explains the full flow of the application from start to finish, ensuring every feature and page is clearly connected.

# Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
Upon arriving at the application, users will see a clean and engaging Home or Landing page that acts as the introduction to the Deep Job Search service. There is a clear call-to-action on this page inviting users to get started with their job search. As authentication and user account creation are planned as future enhancements, the initial flow does not require users to sign in. Instead, users can begin immediately by clicking the 'Get Started' button, which takes them directly to the resume upload process. In scenarios where future versions include sign-in, a simple email-based or social login option, along with mechanisms for password recovery, would be integrated seamlessly. For now, the onboarding process is straightforward and does not require complex sign-up steps, providing a focus on the core functionalities.

# Main Dashboard or Home Page
After the initial onboarding, users are greeted by the Home page which serves as the main dashboard. This page is structured with a header or navbar that clearly shows navigation options as well as brief descriptions of the core feature, such as resume upload and job research initiation. The home page encourages users to move forward in the process and outlines what they can expect as they proceed through the application. The clear layout and intuitive design ensure that users understand where to go next, whether they are starting with uploading their resume or exploring additional information about the service.

# Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
The journey begins on the Home page where users click the prominent call-to-action button to start the process. This action takes them to the Resume Upload page, a dedicated screen that provides a modern, easy-to-use interface for uploading a resume in PDF or image formats. This page incorporates a drag-and-drop area as well as a traditional file input, making the file selection process user-friendly. As soon as a resume is uploaded, the application makes a POST request to the backend endpoint responsible for file processing. The backend extracts text using OCR if needed and generates a summary of the candidate’s skills, experiences, and achievements.

If the resume is successfully processed, a brief preview or summary is displayed to the user, along with an option to continue to the next step. The user is then navigated to the Preferences page. On the Preferences page, the user finds interactive fields to enter or select job preferences, such as desired location, company size, and role type. The design is intuitive, allowing users to easily adjust setting parameters like remote possibility or slider inputs for company scale. Once the necessary preferences are set, the user clicks a continue button which triggers another API call to generate a deep research prompt based on both the parsed resume data and their specified preferences.

After the backend processes the request and generates a curated list of matching job openings, the application navigates the user to the Results page. This page shows a clean, organized list or card layout of job listings, including key details such as job title, company name, location, and direct links to apply. Users can click the 'Apply' link that opens detailed application instructions in a new tab. Additionally, there is an option to refine the search if the initial results need further customization, ensuring that the navigation between pages is smooth and the overall user experience analytic and responsive.

# Settings and Account Management
At the moment, detailed account management is not included in the initial release since user accounts and authentication are planned as future enhancements. However, the Preferences page functions as a temporary settings area where users can adjust their job search parameters and update the criteria used for formulating the deep research prompt. Once advanced user account features are introduced, a dedicated Settings section will allow users to manage personal information, update preferences, and configure notifications. For now, changing job preferences during a session or starting a new search is managed through the navigation options in the header, allowing users to quickly return to the Preferences page, make adjustments, and subsequently regenerate or refine their job listings.

# Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user attempts to upload a file with an unsupported format or if the file quality is too low, error messages are promptly displayed on the Resume Upload page. The interface is designed to clearly explain the nature of the error, whether it is related to file type, OCR failure, or connectivity issues with the backend. In the case of network interruptions or issues with the OpenAI API, the application shows user-friendly fallback messages encouraging the user to try again later. Similarly, if any invalid data is entered in the Preferences page, clear prompts are provided so that correction can be made before proceeding. These error states do not break the application but instead guide users back to proper flow, ensuring that all alternate paths lead towards a successful job search experience.

# Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the welcoming Home page to the streamlined process of uploading a resume, setting job preferences, and finally receiving curated job listings, the Deep Job Search application is designed to be simple yet powerful. The user begins by being introduced to the service on the Home page, then moves effortlessly into the resume upload stage. Once the resume is processed and summarized, they configure their job search preferences in a dedicated settings-like interface. The deep research prompt is then generated, leading to a Results page filled with personalized job listings with actionable links. This end-to-end journey demonstrates how the application brings together modern web technologies and artificial intelligence to offer a unique, efficient pathway toward finding the ideal job match.
